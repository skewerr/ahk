# ahk
A collection of AutoHotKey scripts I use and/or wrote.

Only `Other.ahk` and `WorkspaceSwitch.ahk` are mine. `Other.ahk` has a function and two hotkeys that weren't done by me. I-it's not like I wouldn't have done shit, it was already out there and... ;-;

## Other

General purpose AHK script, has easy to understand - in my opinion - sections.

## WorkspaceSwitch

Previously had a repo for itself called bbLeanSwitch. Ditched that and the name. Might work on it again someday.

What it does: keeps track of position, size, and state for AIMP3 and HexChat windows on my 5 bbLean workspaces. By state, I mean Minimized/Restored for HexChat, Tray/MainWindow/Hidden for AIMP3.

## RemoveWindowCaptions

Not mine. It can remove the caption bar on all windows, but I don't need that. What I did was change it a little so that it'd remove captions for all but the main window of Pale Moon (web browser). It resizes them a pixel down then up again because of a glitch that makes a blank space at the bottom appear after hiding the caption bar.

## IconBlanker

Not mine. As its name indicates, it replaces window icons with a blank icon. Regardless of what it may advertise, it only works for new windows after the script starts.

## CursorHider

Not mine. I had problems with the default Windows 7 feature of hiding the mouse as the user is typing. It just didn't work properly. I found this script while looking for a solution and I'm quite pleased with it.
